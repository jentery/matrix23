"Generative AI" Panel |[The Matrix Institute](https://onlineacademiccommunity.uvic.ca/matrix/events/)  
with Callum Curtis, Yun Lu, Valerie Irvine, George Tzanetakis    
Moderated by Neil Ernst (Computer Science)

# Generative AI 

*Prompt for the Panel*: Prepare a brief opening statement (2-4 minutes) to engage discussion about DALL-E, ChatGPT, and academia. "What is the current state of these tools? What do we anticipate happening, and how should academia and industry prepare?"

## Opening Statement (2-4 minutes)

This morning I wish to respond to Neil's prompt, which asked us how we might prepare for generative AI, with two suggestions that I believe are actionable. 

1) My first suggestion is that we enrich our language models and even entertain the possibility that language cannot be modeled. A starting point here may be academic debates during the 1980s about the question of intent. Many argued, and I agree, that speech is not the same as language. I may mean what I say, but I cannot say exactly what I mean. Why? Because language is fundamentally social, and --- stronger --- language and history speak through me when I communicate, hence phenomena such as semantic drift and polysemy, which I cannot control. As Yale English professor, Paul Fry, reminds us, "[l]anguage is an unintentional speech" (2012). Thinking of language this way, as something incredibly difficult if not impossible to model, prepares us to bypass the proverbial game of, "Was it written by a human or a bot?" The most recent GPT-4 technical report suggests, for instance, that the model could be power-seeking (yikes!), and of course it produces content that both can be circulated, edited, recontextualized, and so on. What matters most, then, is that AI is a *relation*, not whether a bot says exactly what it means or even means what it says. 

2) Following this point is my second and final one: we can prepare for generative AI and engage it by keeping it social: by organizing around it and negotiating with it, if only by slowing it down a bit. The reality is most of us, and arguably all academics, have practically no control over the technologies foisted upon us. When I teach media studies at UVic, I like to remind students that technologies do not fall from the sky and produce ripple effects. They have complex cultural histories before they congeal into the gadgets we use. Yet, as ChatGPT demonstrated, technologies may nevertheless *feel* as if they've arrived from nowhere and may thus put us in a state of alarm attended by popular QA testing. *Does it work?* *What does it do?* *How do I recognize it?* AI-cloaking initiatives such as the Glaze Project at the University of Chicago interest me for this reason, as do ongoing unionization efforts involving new technologies and platforms. When we talk about generative AI, we are also talking about deskilling and precarity: about labour developments that will disproportionately affect those who are already vulnerable. Filmmaker, Hito Steyerl, recently said that generative AI is really just an onboarding tool for tech conglomerates (2023). I agree, and I imagine many of us will be onboarded into an occupational dependency whether we like it or not. Perhaps what I'm about to say suggests I'm just naively optimistic on a Friday; still, I maintain hope that a critical stance on AI means not only asking how it works, what it values, by whom it's built, and whom it benefits most but also reminding each other that it's a lived experience and not merely a tool.
